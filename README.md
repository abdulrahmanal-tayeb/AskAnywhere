## Ask Anywhere Frontend Application (ReactJS)

**Description:**

This is a ReactJS-based frontend for a question-answers application based on tickets. It prioritizes a clean and user-friendly design.

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js installed on your machine

**Installation:**

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Run the following commands:

```bash
npm install

npm start
```

**Notes**
1. Some endpoints are having problems **(500 Internal Server Error)** such as the `Ticket Detail` and the `Logout` API endpoints. **No worries!** The work around for the ticket detail page is to **open/close** it to fetch the updated ticket and see its details reflected in the page!

2. The `Register` endpoint **often** throws ambiguous error messages, even though all data is being passed correctly.

3. There is no endpoint to obtain the user information to use it when creating tickets. Users **have to register** for an account even though they have one in order to get their details.

**Ready to Go!**
